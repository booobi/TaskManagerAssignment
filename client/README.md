## Setup

1.  Run `npm i` to install packages
2.  Run `npm start`
3.  (Optional) If you want to use the Redux DevTools, you can uncomment them from the ``src/app/app.module.ts`` file. Note that you have make sure that your browser (firefox or chrome) has the [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) extension installed.

Client should now be running and be available at http://localhost:4200/.

I've taken advantage of the following additional packages:
* rxjs: 6.4.0
* @ngrx/store: 8.4.0
* @ngrx/effects: 8.4.0
* @ngrx/store-devtools: 8.4.0
* bootstrap: 4.3.1
* font-awesome: 4.7.0
